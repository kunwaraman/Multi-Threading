1. Introduction to Multithreading
Definition: Explain what multithreading is and why it's essential in modern applications.
Advantages: Speed up processing time, efficient resource utilization, etc.
Challenges: Race conditions, deadlocks, resource sharing, etc.
Basic Example: A simple "Hello World" example with threads.
2. Creating Threads
Using Thread Class:
Example of extending Thread class.
Implementing Runnable Interface:
Example of implementing Runnable interface.
Using Callable and Future for Returning Results:
Example showing how Callable allows threads to return results and handle exceptions.
3. Thread Lifecycle
Explain the states of a thread (New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated).
Code examples to demonstrate each state.
4. Thread Synchronization
Synchronized Methods and Blocks:
Example showing how to use synchronized to prevent race conditions.
Locking Mechanisms:
Explanation and example using ReentrantLock.
Volatile Keyword:
Explain volatile and its role in visibility of changes across threads.
5. Concurrency Utilities
Executors Framework:
Example showing thread pooling using ExecutorService.
CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier:
Examples demonstrating both synchronization aids.
Semaphores:
Example using Semaphore to control access to resources.
BlockingQueue:
Example of a producer-consumer problem using BlockingQueue.
6. Thread Safety
Immutable Objects:
Explanation and example of how immutability can help with thread safety.
Atomic Variables:
Example using AtomicInteger or other atomic classes from java.util.concurrent.atomic.
7. Advanced Topics
Deadlock and Avoidance Techniques:
Example showing deadlock and techniques to avoid it.
Thread Local Storage:
Example showing ThreadLocal for thread-specific data.
ForkJoinPool for Parallelism:
Example of using ForkJoinPool for dividing tasks.
8. Real-World Scenarios
Producer-Consumer Problem: A detailed example with multiple producers and consumers.
Dining Philosophers Problem: A classic concurrency problem and solution.
Web Server Simulation: Using threads to handle multiple requests.
9. Common Mistakes and Debugging
Common Pitfalls: Race conditions, deadlocks, incorrect synchronization, etc.
Debugging Tools: Thread dumps, debugging techniques for multithreading issues.
10. Additional Resources
Links to documentation, books, and tutorials on multithreading.
Recommended books like Java Concurrency in Practice.
